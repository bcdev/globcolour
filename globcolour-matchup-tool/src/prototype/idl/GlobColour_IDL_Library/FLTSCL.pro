FUNCTION FLTSCL, Array, HIGH=high, LOW=low
;+
; NAME
;     FLTSCL
; VERSION
;     1.0
; PURPOSE
;     The FLTSCL function scales all values of Array that lie in the range (Min <= x <= Max) into the range (low <= x <= High).
; Syntax
;     Result = FLTSCL( Array [, High=high] [, LOW=low] )

; KEYWORDS:
;     HIGH - Set this keyword to the maximum value of the output scaled Array, default is 1
;     LOW - Set this keyword to the maximum value of the output scaled Array, default is 0
; CATEGORY:
;       Data scaling
