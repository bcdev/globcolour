FUNCTION YP_SIGTEST, r, N

;+
; NAME:
;       YP_SIGTEST
; VERSION
;       1.0
; PURPOSE:
;    Significance Test of correlation for a sample size = N
;    N:    Number of observations
;    r:    Correlation coefficient
;    Pr:   Probaility that random noise could produce the result (correlation) with N samples
;       Pr=ERFC(r*sqrt(N/2))
;    ERFC: Complementary Error Function
;    rsig: At which we have 100*(1-limit) chance that random data would produce this result (r)
;       rsig=INVERF(limit)*sqrt(2/N)
;
; Interpretation:
;       Any "r" value greater than "rsig" are significant at "limit*100" level
;
; INPUT:
;       r
;       N
;
; OUTPUT:
;       2-element array [significance level, probability]
;
; Example:
;   IDL> result = YP_SIGTEST(0.67, 23)
;   IDL> print, result
;     99.000000    0.0013126156
